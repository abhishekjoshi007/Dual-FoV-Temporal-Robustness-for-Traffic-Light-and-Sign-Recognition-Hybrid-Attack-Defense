DATASET USAGE NOTICE
================================================================================

This software uses publicly available datasets that must be obtained separately
from their original providers under their respective licenses. The code in this
repository (preprocessing scripts, model implementations, evaluation tools) is
licensed under MIT, but the datasets have their own restrictions:

1. aiMotive 3D Traffic Light and Sign Dataset
   License: Research use only (Kaggle Terms of Service)
   Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tamasmatuszka/aimotive-3d-traffic-light-and-sign-dataset
   Restrictions: Must accept Kaggle ToS and dataset-specific terms

2. Waymo Open Dataset
   License: Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 4.0 International (CC BY-NC 4.0)
   Source: https://waymo.com/open/
   Restrictions: NON-COMMERCIAL USE ONLY
   Attribution: Must cite Waymo Open Dataset paper

3. Udacity Self-Driving Car Dataset
   License: MIT License
   Source: https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car
   Restrictions: None (MIT allows commercial use)

4. Texas Sequences (proprietary)
   License: Available upon request for research purposes
   Source: Contact ajoshi5@islander.tamucc.edu
   Restrictions: Requires signed Data Use Agreement (DUA)

================================================================================
COMBINED BENCHMARK LICENSE
================================================================================

Due to the most restrictive license (Waymo CC BY-NC 4.0), any combined benchmark
created using these datasets is restricted to:

✓ PERMITTED USES:
  - Academic research
  - Educational purposes
  - Non-commercial publications
  - Method comparison and evaluation

✗ PROHIBITED USES:
  - Commercial applications
  - Production deployment in commercial products
  - Redistribution of original source data
  - Sale or sublicensing of dataset combinations

================================================================================
REPRODUCTION COMPLIANCE
================================================================================

This repository provides:
  1. Preprocessing scripts (MIT licensed)
  2. Frame selection indices (factual data, not copyrightable)
  3. Documentation for dataset reconstruction

Users MUST:
  1. Download original datasets from their respective sources
  2. Accept each dataset's original license terms
  3. Run provided preprocessing scripts to create the benchmark
  4. Comply with the most restrictive license (Waymo CC BY-NC 4.0)

This approach follows precedent from COCO, ImageNet, and similar benchmarks
that provide tools for dataset creation rather than redistributing source data.

================================================================================
THIRD-PARTY DEPENDENCIES

This software uses the following open-source libraries:

- PyTorch (BSD-3-Clause License)
- Ultralytics YOLOv8 (AGPL-3.0 License)
- OpenCV (Apache-2.0 License)
- NumPy (BSD License)
- SciPy (BSD License)
